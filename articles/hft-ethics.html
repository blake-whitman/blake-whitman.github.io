<h1>Ethical Implications of High Frequency Trading Algorithms</h1>
<p>The modern era of finance has brought about a multitude of
technological advancements, from simple online brokerages to
the hoard of available information on the internet. Ultimately,
the ubiquitous nature of technology within finance has led to
newfound responsibilities for software engineers. Programmers
employed by large firms have increasingly begun to leverage
technology in their algorithms. As a result, average trade size
has fallen substantially as programmers enact ”high frequency”
trading strategies. These strategies, often deemed ”high
frequency trading” or ”HFT” for short, have altered the way
markets work around the world. They also raise the question
of whether it is ethically permissible for software engineers to
enact HFT algorithms.</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide an answer to that question using consequentialism, 
  the ACM code of ethics, and evidence from the industry. Programmers using HFT algorithms 
  can be ethically permissible due to increased market liquidity and efficiency, reduced costs, 
  and profitability. Alternatively, detractors consider an engineer's role in HFT not ethically 
  permissible because of potential market manipulation alongside the cascading effect HFT can have on the markets. 
  To reach a conclusion, we analyze the theory of consequentialism, view consequences of programmers coding HFT algorithms, 
  and provide ethical support for their continuance. Lastly, the legal ramification of no longer needing to advocate against 
  HFT will be discussed before offering concluding remarks. Taking both sides into consideration, this paper postulates that 
  programmers engaging in HFT is ethically permissible because it fulfills both the optimific framework of consequentialism and 
  multiple ACM ethical guidelines.</p>
<h2>The Ethics of HFT</h2>
<p>High frequency trading describes the combination of mathe-
matical modeling and computer science algorithms. An example of an algorithm commonly developed is statistical arbitrage.
The method compares historical data from stocks that typically
move up or down simultaneously. Programmers use algorithms
that track their movements and when one stock drifts apart,
automated trades are executed to take advantage of the price
difference. Highly efficient time complexity solutions are a
necessity, so programmers hired possess a thorough command
of C++ or Python.</p>
<p>Consequentialism states that ”an action is morally required
just because it produces the best overall results,” which is
synonymous with an action being optimific. More specifically, we use “act utilitarianism” which acts as a subset of
consequentialism. In section four, the specific steps toward
determining whether programmers writing HFT code qualifies
as optimific will be examined.</p>
<p>In practice, programmers are given the following guidelines:
trading regulations with which their algorithms must comply,
the firm’s code of conduct that states one should serve the
best interests of clients, and the assurance that they provide
liquidity to the markets. These rules are difficult to enforce,
though, considering the highly secretive nature of hedge fund
strategies. This can lead to certain problems, both morally and
economically, which we analyze in the next section.</p>
<h2>Advantages and Externalities</h2>
<p>HFT has several potential and realized ethical pitfalls. Consider a first example, involving the NYC firm Trillium Capital.
In 2010, Trillium programmers used code to influence the
market in their favor. They commenced a series of trades
that are referred to as “spoofing,” which occurs when trades
are entered without the intention of following through on
them. This then induces others to initiate trades based on
the illusion of demand. Trillium profited from the increased
demand before selling their holdings. Trades of this caliber
are illegal because they cause market movements that would
not ordinarily happen. The scheme is also sometimes deemed
a “pump and dump” due to the artificial pumping up of the
security before it is subsequently dumped.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the “flash crash” of 2010 is another event
largely attributed to HFT. When algorithms across firms each
share similar criteria for execution, they can create a cascading
effect across the entirety of the market. This can cause
instantaneous crashes such as the one observed in 2010.  
</p>
<p>
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we see merits of
HFT. The SEC concluded that HFT improves market liquidity. Improved liquidity leads to lower prices for retail traders.
At the same time, stakeholders receive more benefits from
HFT than negatives. The economy, financial system, political
system, consumers, and individuals and their families are all
identified as positively impacted stakeholders. HFT even
promotes ethics by forcing competition between other financial
companies within sectors that are perceived to be less ethical.
Each of these positive aspects work in favor of programmers
coding HFT algorithms.
</p>
<h2>Thoughts on the Current Discourse</h2>
<p>To begin our application of consequentialism, consider the
following steps that determine whether programmers utilizing
HFT are acting optimifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>To begin, it is necessary to identify what is intrinsically good. Common selections include happiness, autonomy,
knowledge, and virtue.</li>
<li>Next, consider the opposite–what is intrinsically bad? Mental
and physical pain, betrayal of innocents, and sadistic tendencies
are cited as meeting this criteria.</li>
<li>Programmers engaging in HFT have a wide variety of
options when creating algorithms. They can pursue maximal
financial gain by exploiting regulations. They can increase
knowledge of the financial mathematics sector of academia.
They can put their own happiness first and prioritize work-life
balance. This encompasses the third step; what options do the
programmers have?</li>
<li>Assigning each of step three’s actions to a value is difficult,
but not entirely incomprehensible. Prioritizing financial gain by
breaking rules falls closer to “bad,” while increasing happiness
and knowledge are both good options. This leads us to the final
step.</li>
<li>Step five says that we need to make the optimific choice.
Following our criteria in steps one and two, it is evident that
maximizing knowledge and the happiness of consumers would
lead to the most good in the most people.</li>
</ol>
<p>That was a thought exercise that demonstrates the optimific
principle of consequentialism. But what occurs in reality? If
reality follows the optimific choice closely, then it will be safe
to conclude that programmers engaging in HFT are behaving
ethically.</p>
<p>Recent years have shown HFT to be increasingly interesting
in academia, as academics have begun researching market
microstructure. There are around 3,000 academic papers on
academia.edu related to the topic, which speaks to the knowl-
edge incited by HFT. Software engineers inherently respect
the ideas of their colleagues by using citations, which follows
ACM code principle 1.5. HFT also improves the happiness
and financial well-being of consumers, which again stems from
the ACM code. It is estimated that programmers utilizing
HFT save Vanguard investors hundreds of millions of dollars
each year. Executing more trades at a faster rate increases
market speed while lowering overhead costs.</p>
<p>Market manipulation tactics perpetually exist, and they re-
main immoral. Programmers engaging in HFT as it is intended
avoid harm, as stated within the code of ethics. This appeals
to the concept of expected results within consequentialism.
Software engineers are not attempting to perform algorithms
that lead to “flash crashes” and manipulation. Anyone in their
shoes can reasonably expect to increase liquidity and profit for
investors.</p>
<h2>Overarching Implications</h2>
<p>Since we have determined that programmers formulating
HFT algorithms is ethically permissible, that means there are
implications stemming from that realization. One which we
focus on here is legality. In 2013, the SEC introduced MIDAS
to regulate cases of spoofing. With our conclusion in
tow, MIDAS remains relevant to reduce exploitation. The only
legal implication that would alter would be to eliminate the
stance that HFT should be eliminated. As we alluded to above,
ridding the markets of HFT would reduce liquidity, thus raising
prices for all consumers. Since programming HFT algorithms
is ethically permissible, the legal onus to abolish the practice
is no longer necessary.</p>
<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>Technology has forever changed the financial industry. Questioning whether current practices are unethical will ensure
individuals are held to the same standards as they previously
were, regardless of technological advances.</p>
<p>
In this paper, we have applied this line of questioning
to software engineers utilizing high frequency trading. Using
principles of consequentialism, it is evident that programmers
designing HFT algorithms are not behaving unethically. Their
goals include improving knowledge and happiness, while any
negative consequences can be reduced to unanticipated events.
Overall, the results are optimific and yield the best ratio of
good to bad, which allows us to conclude that programmers
coding HFT algorithms is ethically permissible.
